# Spring-boot war issue - minimal case

This was intended as a minimal testcase to help identify and resolve [spring-projects/spring-boot#7949](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/7949)

As I understand it, this issue was fixed by the Spring Boot team before the release of 1.5.0.
I have adjusted the spring boot version in the pom.xml to 1.5.0.RELEASE, in which everything works as intended.
